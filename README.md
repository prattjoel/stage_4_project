# stage_4_project
Allow comments website for udacty intro to programmng nano degree.
I use templates to put content from course materials on different webpages.
Each page should have a content and a comments section (using google app engine) of it's own.
So far there are only three content pages but I will add additional pages when the code is functioning properly.
