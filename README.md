# stage_4_project
Goal: create a webpage that contains course information from the udacty intro to programmng nano degree and allows users to leave comments.
Templates are used to put content from course materials on different webpages.
Google app engine is used to generate the comments section.
Each page should have it's own content and a comments section.
So far there are only three pages. I will add additional pages when the code is functioning properly.
