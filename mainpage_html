        <div class="concept-description">
          <p>The internet is a combination of browsers (used by computers), HTML documents, and servers storing those documents. Information on the web goes to and from servers (big stationary computers) through HTML to browsers on personal computers that people use regularly. This <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/class/msande91si/www-spr04/readings/week1/InternetWhitepaper.htm">link</a> has more information.

            HTML is the programming language used to create websites. The information contained on servers is saved as HTML documents.  When a person types a HTTP request to a server, an HTML document is 
            retrieved.  This document then presents a web page to the person
            who typed in the HTTP request.  Since HTML is used to create
            web pages, it can be used to modify websites.  But you have
            to be careful when speaking with a computer via HTML because
            computers aren't very smart. They won't respond correctly unless
            you give them exactly what they're looking for. So make sure you speak
            their language.

            Tags and elements are used to communicate with computers in HTML.  HTML is made of elemnts that are assigned a type through tags.  Two kinds of elements are 'inline' and 'block' elements.  'Block'elements are contained in boxes.  An example of a 'block' element in HTML is a paragraph.

            This course offered a number of ways to change the way we think about computer programing.  One that stood out to me was the importance of understanding foundational conepts rather than trying to memorize all the details.  Since you can always look up specific concepts like <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_font_size.asp">how to change the font in HTML</a>, it's more important to understand how to find and apply information than to know everything by memory.  After all, nobody could memorize all the details of programming anyway.
